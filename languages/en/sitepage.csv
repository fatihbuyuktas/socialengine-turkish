"Page Profile Layout DESCRIPTION";"From the Global Settings of this plugin, you
have allowed Sayfa Owners to be able to arrange, add and remove widgets from the
profile of their Sayfalar. However, you still have control over what Sayfa Profile
widgets should be available to Sayfa Owners, which widgets they should NOT be
able to remove, and which ones they should be able to remove. If you have added
a new plugin on your site, and would like its widget to be shown on Sayfa
Profiles and NOT be removable by Sayfa Owners, then you can drop that widget into
Sayfa Profile below. If you would like to show an announcement, or any HTML
content on Sayfa Profiles, and NOT allow Sayfa Owners to be able to remove it,
then you can do that as well below. If there is a widget coming on profiles of
Sayfalar of your site that you want to be removed, then you can do that below; and
many more such actions.
If you drop a widget from a different plugin into the Sayfa Profile, then Sayfa
Owners will NOT be able to remove it or drag-n-drop it. If you ""lock"" a Sayfa
Profile widget that has NOT been placed in the Sayfa Profile Placement area, then
that widget will NOT be available to Sayfa Owners for placing on the Sayfa. If you
""lock"" a Sayfa Profile widget that has been placed in the Sayfa Profile
Placement area, then Sayfa Owners will NOT be able to remove it or drag-n-drop
it.<br />NOTE: If you have placed ""Ad Campaign"" or ""Html Block"" on this sayfa, then
once you click on the ""Save Changes"" link, you will neither be able to change
the position nor edit that block. So, if you want to do so, you will have to
remove that block from the Sayfa and save changes and then place it again from
the Available Blocks."
